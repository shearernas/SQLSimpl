# SQLSimpl

**Making MySQL simple for everyone!**

SQLSimpl is an open-source website and lightweight web app designed to make learning SQL accessible and approachable for beginners. The project breaks down complex SQL concepts into digestible modules with step-by-step instructions, visual aids, and interactive quizzes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

SQLSimpl aims to eliminate the intimidation factor when learning SQL by:

- Breaking complex concepts into easy-to-understand modules
- Using relatable metaphors and examples (like comparing databases to spreadsheets)
- Providing visual step-by-step installation guides
- Including interactive elements to reinforce learning
- Creating a friendly, approachable tone and language throughout the curriculum

This project is specifically designed for people who:
- Feel intimidated by technical topics but want to challenge themselves
- Need to learn SQL for job opportunities or career advancement
- Prefer learning at their own pace in a structured environment
- Appreciate a simple, uncluttered interface when they learn online

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

SQLSimpl is organized into distinct learning modules:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to MySQL, installation guides, and basic theory
- **Module 2**: Creating databases, tables, and basic DDL *(coming soon)*
- **Module 3**: Simple queries *(coming soon)*
- **Module 4**: Advanced queries and joins *(coming soon)*

Each module contains:
- Clear learning objectives
- Simple explanations with relatable metaphors
- Step-by-step tutorials with images
- Simple, interactive quizzes to test understanding

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

SQLSimpl is built to be simple, quick, and lightweight, so that it loads in less than a second and anyone can view it on any older or updated web browser:

- **HTML**: Core content structure and semantic markup
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive layout, navigation, and UI components
- **Custom CSS**: Consistent visual identity and branding
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Quiz functionality and answer validation
- **Floating-UI.js**: Enhanced tooltips and dropdown menus

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Hard Way**
1. Clone this repository
2. Unzip the contents of the file

4. Begin your SQL learning journey!

No build process or complex setup required - just pure web technologies that work right out of the box.

## ðŸ‘¥ Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help make SQL learning (or any other subject) more accessible:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

I plan to eventually use SQLSimpl as a framework for barrier-free design principles for other technical topics in the future. 
SQL was a great entrypoint into this due to my familiarity with it but, realistically, this framework could be used for any other programming language or technical topic that could be taught to people using instructional design and accessible design principles in mind.

## ðŸ“‹ To-Do

- Create installation tutorials for Windows and Linux for Module 1 - Topic 4
- Finish implementing content for Modules 2 through 4
- Responsive design so that the website can be viewed on mobile devices (currently only a few pages work on mobile)
- CSS optimization
- Improve alt text on images and screen reader accessiblity for other elements like buttons
- Fixing image size to be consistent for every page
- Syntax highlighting for code snippets
- Proper dropdown menu for side navbar section in Module reading topics
- Define consistent rules for margins, padding, font size, and whitespace so that design is consistent across the whole website 
- Always working on improving language to be more accessible and friendly
- Go all out and design a more detailed visual identity system for the website (brand kit, logo, simple supporting graphics, etc.)
